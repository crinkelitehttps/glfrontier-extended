/*
 * gamepad.h - game controllers (SDL GameController: Xbox, PlayStation,
 * Switch and most others), mapped by a binding file onto the game's
 * steering, look-around in the cockpit and keyboard keys.
 *
 * The bindings come from gamepad.cfg in the working directory (beside
 * glfrontier.cfg); it is written with the built-in default (gamepad.c,
 * which documents the format) the first time the game runs without one.
 *
 * Analog steering goes straight into the game's keyboard / joystick
 * steering words (A6+14508 x, A6+14510 y: what A/Z and ,/. ramp up), so
 * the stick's position is the turn rate.
