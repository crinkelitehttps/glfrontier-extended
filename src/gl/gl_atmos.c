/*
 * gl_atmos.c - atmosphere haze.
 *
 * Near a planet the game builds its atmosphere (sky haze on the ground,
 * the glowing rim seen from space) as 2D shapes, bands between two bezier
 * curves, and puts them at the back of its software depth tree. No GL hook
 * draws them; the GL depth node made for each one remembers the address of
 * the game's node (PRIM_SOFT_NODE), and once the game has filled it in
 * the band is copied out (the cockpit reuses that memory for its next
 * pass, and the colour ids are only valid now). The band is filled when
 * that node is drawn, so it lands in exactly the game's draw order.
 *
 * Band node layout (words, after the 12 byte tree header):
 *   42                            start shape
 *   90  x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3   bezier edge
 *   56  x0 y0 x1 y1               straight edge
 *   104 colour_id                 fill (even-odd) and end
 * Coordinates are 3D view pixels: x 0..320, y 0..168 downwards. The copy
 * is the same words from the first edge on, with the fill's colour id
 * replaced by its rgb444 value.
 *
 * Those shapes only fit the view the game drew them for, so the cockpit's
 * turned passes (gl_cockpit.c) would each draw slightly different bands that
 * jog where the passes meet. There the bands are drawn in 3D instead, as
 * rings round the planet (AtmosBand): a hook in fe2.s (Lcockpit_band) tells
 * Nu_AtmosBand each band's scale and colour as the game builds it,
 * Nu_PutPlanet, which comes after the bands, says which planet they are
 * round, and scene_draw has every pass draw them (atmos_draw_bands).
 *
 * The game makes each band by scaling the previous band's outer edge (the
 * planet's horizon arc for the first) by the band's scale about a pivot
 * towards the planet's centre, 2 * $600 = 3072 view pixels away (the code
 * before Lcockpit_band's hook; landed on Merlin the bands are 48 view
 * pixels deep for scales multiplying to 1.0151, so 3190, and from orbit
 * just as deep). Band n's outer edge is then (S - 1) * 3072 view pixels
 * beyond the planet's edge, S being the product of the scales so far: in
 * angles, (S - 1) * 3072 / f radians, f being the game's focal length in
 * view pixels.
