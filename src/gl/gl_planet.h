/*
 * gl_planet.h - planet rendering.
 *
 * The game's planet routine builds the planet as a 2D shape list for its
 * software renderer and then (label fuck_planet in fe2_modded.s.c) calls hostcall
 * 0x78 -> Nu_PutPlanet. Everything the GL renderer knows about a planet is
 * captured there into PlanetDesc, including a copy of that 2D list.
 *
 * 2D planet list format (words, 3D view pixel coordinates):
 *   156                                    start
 *   166 x0 y0 x1 y1 code                   straight edge
 *   182 x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 code       bezier edge
 *   198 row code                           region code change at a row
 *   208 id x16                             colour table (dynamic colour ids),
 *                                          ends the shape and fills it
 * The software renderer fills it scanline by scanline, XOR-ing edge codes to
 * pick a colour from the table.
 *
 * To add planet features (surface detail, shading, rings, ...):
 *   1. Add fields to PlanetDesc.
 *   2. Fill them in Nu_PutPlanet() from emulated RAM. Only copy data there:
 *      RAM will have changed by draw time.
 *   3. Draw them in draw_planet(), with gd_* geometry, fill2d_* shapes or
 *      another gd_custom() GPU pass.
