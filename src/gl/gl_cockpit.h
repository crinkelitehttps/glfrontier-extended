/*
 * gl_cockpit.h - the 3D cockpit view: the flight view seen from a seat in
 * the ship, looking around with head tracking (headtrack.c).
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS
 *   The world fills the window with a real perspective and the head's
 *   rotation. The game's own 2D drawing over its 3D view (HUD, target
 *   brackets, planets and atmosphere, which the game draws as 2D shapes)
 *   lives in "view pixels": x 0..320, y 0..168 downwards, each pixel a
 *   direction through the game's original projection. In the cockpit those
 *   pixels are put back on that direction, far away and turning with the
 *   world, so they stay on what they mark (a collimated display). The
 *   control panel (screen rows 168..200) is a texture on a panel below,
 *   which also moves with the head's position. Mouse positions are mapped
 *   back through the same surfaces.
 *
 *   The game itself only draws what is inside its own view (about 64 x 36
 *   degrees). To show the world all round, the game draws it several times
 *   a frame with the camera turned (a hook in fe2.s calls Call_CockpitPass
 *   around each pass): only the directions the head can see this frame,
 *   from a fixed set that covers the whole sphere. Each pass is its own
 *   depth tree in gl_scene.c, drawn turned back by its rotation and kept by
 *   the stencil buffer to its own part of the view. The game's 2D shapes
 *   only fit the view it made them for, so would jog where passes meet:
 *   in the cockpit, planets are drawn as spheres (gl_planet.c) and their
 *   atmosphere bands as rings round them (gl_atmos.c) instead.
 *
 *   Only in the front flight view, when the cockpit is enabled and the free
 *   camera is off; everything else keeps the classic letterboxed layout.
